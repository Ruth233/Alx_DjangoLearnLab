# LibraryProject

This is the initial Django project setup for learning Django under **Alx_DjangoLearnLab**.

## Steps Followed
1. Installed Django using pip.
2. Created a Django project named `LibraryProject`.
3. Ran the development server and confirmed the default Django welcome page.
4. Explored the default project structure:
   - **manage.py** → A command-line tool to interact with the project.
   - **settings.py** → Contains configurations for the project (database, apps, middleware, etc.).
   - **urls.py** → Defines URL patterns for the project.
   - **wsgi.py/asgi.py** → Interfaces between the web server and Django.

## Run Instructions
```bash
cd LibraryProject
python manage.py runserver
